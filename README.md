# üå¶ Weather Monitoring System

A **remote weather monitoring system** that collects real-time environmental data using various sensors, sends it to the **Anedya IoT Cloud** via a **Python REST API**, and visualizes it using **Grafana**.  
This system helps monitor temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, soil moisture, and UV index from anywhere in the world.

This project was developed as part of an **internship with Anedya IoT Cloud**, where all monitoring is performed using **Grafana Observability & Monitoring**.

üîß Hardware Components
1Ô∏è‚É£ DHT11 / DHT22 Sensor
Function: Measures temperature and humidity.
How it works:
Uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor.
The humidity sensor changes capacitance based on moisture in the air.
The thermistor changes resistance based on temperature.

An internal chip converts readings into digital signals for the microcontroller.
2Ô∏è‚É£ BMP180 (Barometric Pressure Sensor)
Function: Measures atmospheric pressure and estimates altitude.
How it works:
Contains a piezo-resistive pressure sensor that deforms under atmospheric pressure.
Deformation changes the resistance of the sensor material.
Built-in ADC converts resistance changes into a pressure value, which can be used for altitude calculations.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Soil Moisture Sensor
Function: Detects water content in soil.
How it works:
Two conductive probes are inserted into the soil.
Water allows better electrical conductivity.
Measures resistance between probes ‚Äî more water = lower resistance.
Outputs analog or digital signals to the microcontroller.

4Ô∏è‚É£ UV Index Sensor
Function: Measures UV radiation levels to determine UV index.
How it works:
Uses a photodiode that reacts to UV light.
Generates a small electrical current when UV rays hit it.
An internal IC converts this current to a voltage signal
The microcontroller reads the voltage to calculate the UV index.

5Ô∏è‚É£ 0.96" OLED Display
Function: Displays live weather data.
How it works:
OLED pixels emit light when current passes through organic compounds.
No backlight needed ‚Äî high contrast and low power use.
Controlled via I¬≤C interface with NodeMCU.

‚öô Microcontroller ‚Äì NodeMCU ESP8266
Function: Reads sensor data, processes it, and sends it to the cloud.
Advantages:

Low power consumption
Compact & affordable
Supports multiple protocols (I¬≤C, SPI, UART)
Applications:
IoT devices
Smart home automation
Wireless sensor networks
Remote monitoring systems
